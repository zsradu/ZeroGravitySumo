# Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Project Structure Setup (Completed)
- Created base directory structure:
  - `/assets` for game assets and models
  - `/scripts` for JavaScript files
  - `/styles` for CSS files
- Created initial files:
  - `index.html` with HTML5 boilerplate
  - `styles/main.css` with basic reset styles
  - `scripts/main.js` with initialization code
- Verified all files load correctly
- Ready for Three.js integration in Step 2

### Files Created:
1. `index.html`: Main entry point with proper meta tags and responsive viewport
2. `styles/main.css`: Basic styling with black background and overflow handling
3. `scripts/main.js`: Initial JavaScript setup with console verification

## Step 2: Three.js Integration (Completed)
- Added Three.js library via CDN (r128)
- Created `scene.js` with basic 3D setup:
  - Initialized Scene, PerspectiveCamera (FOV 75), and WebGLRenderer
  - Added test cube (green, 1x1x1) at origin
  - Implemented animation loop with cube rotation
  - Added window resize handling
- Updated `main.js` with Three.js verification
- Added responsive canvas sizing

### Files Modified:
1. `index.html`: Added Three.js CDN and scene.js script
2. `scripts/main.js`: Added Three.js load verification

### Files Created:
1. `scripts/scene.js`: Basic Three.js scene setup with test cube

## Step 3: Game Arena Implementation (Completed)
- Replaced test cube with spherical safe zone:
  - Radius: 50 units
  - Material: Transparent green (opacity 0.3)
  - Wireframe enabled for better visibility
- Added visual enhancements:
  - Background stars for depth perception (1000 points)
  - Slow arena rotation (0.001 rad/frame)
  - Antialiasing enabled for smoother rendering
- Adjusted camera position (z=100) to view entire arena

### Files Modified:
1. `scripts/scene.js`: Replaced cube with game arena and added visual improvements

## Step 4: Player Spaceship Creation (Completed)
- Added player spaceship:
  - Used ConeGeometry (radius 1, height 2)
  - Applied green material (#00FF00)
  - Initial random position within ±20 units
  - Rotated to point along length (x-axis)
- Implemented controls:
  - WASD/Arrow keys for rotation
  - Smooth rotation (0.05 rad/frame)
  - Key state tracking for responsive input
- Maintained existing features:
  - Arena rotation
  - Star field
  - Window resizing

### Files Modified:
1. `scripts/scene.js`: Added player ship and keyboard controls

## Step 5: Zero-Gravity Physics Implementation (Completed)
- Created physics system with:
  - Normal thrust (0.5 units/s²)
  - Boost thrust (2.0 units/s²)
  - Damping factor (0.99 per frame)
  - Fixed time step (1/60 second)
- Implemented thrust mechanics:
  - Space key for normal thrust
  - Double-tap Space for boost (2s duration, 10s cooldown)
  - Proper velocity accumulation and damping
- Integrated physics with ship movement:
  - Forward thrust in ship's facing direction
  - Momentum preservation in zero gravity
  - Smooth acceleration and deceleration

### Files Created:
1. `scripts/physics.js`: Physics engine with thrust and zero-gravity mechanics

### Files Modified:
1. `scripts/scene.js`: Added physics integration and thrust controls
2. `index.html`: Added physics.js script reference

### Next Steps:
- Proceed with Step 6: Add collision detection
- Implement sphere collision detection
- Add collision response with velocity exchange

### Test Results:
- Expected: Ship should move forward when Space is held
- Expected: Movement should continue after releasing Space
- Expected: Velocity should gradually decrease due to damping
- Expected: Boost should provide temporary speed increase
- Expected: Ship should maintain proper orientation during movement
