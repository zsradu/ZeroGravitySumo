# Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Project Structure Setup (Completed)
- Created base directory structure:
  - `/assets` for game assets and models
  - `/scripts` for JavaScript files
  - `/styles` for CSS files
- Created initial files:
  - `index.html` with HTML5 boilerplate
  - `styles/main.css` with basic reset styles
  - `scripts/main.js` with initialization code
- Verified all files load correctly
- Ready for Three.js integration in Step 2

### Files Created:
1. `index.html`: Main entry point with proper meta tags and responsive viewport
2. `styles/main.css`: Basic styling with black background and overflow handling
3. `scripts/main.js`: Initial JavaScript setup with console verification

## Step 2: Three.js Integration (Completed)
- Added Three.js library via CDN (r128)
- Created `scene.js` with basic 3D setup:
  - Initialized Scene, PerspectiveCamera (FOV 75), and WebGLRenderer
  - Added test cube (green, 1x1x1) at origin
  - Implemented animation loop with cube rotation
  - Added window resize handling
- Updated `main.js` with Three.js verification
- Added responsive canvas sizing

### Files Modified:
1. `index.html`: Added Three.js CDN and scene.js script
2. `scripts/main.js`: Added Three.js load verification

### Files Created:
1. `scripts/scene.js`: Basic Three.js scene setup with test cube

### Next Steps:
- Proceed with Step 3: Implement game arena
- Create spherical safe zone
- Set up proper transparency for arena boundary

### Test Results:
- Expected: Green rotating cube visible in center of black screen
- Expected: Smooth animation at 60 FPS
- Expected: Proper resize handling
- Expected: No console errors
