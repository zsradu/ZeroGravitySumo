# Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Project Structure Setup (Completed)
- Created base directory structure:
  - `/assets` for game assets and models
  - `/scripts` for JavaScript files
  - `/styles` for CSS files
- Created initial files:
  - `index.html` with HTML5 boilerplate
  - `styles/main.css` with basic reset styles
  - `scripts/main.js` with initialization code
- Verified all files load correctly
- Ready for Three.js integration in Step 2

### Files Created:
1. `index.html`: Main entry point with proper meta tags and responsive viewport
2. `styles/main.css`: Basic styling with black background and overflow handling
3. `scripts/main.js`: Initial JavaScript setup with console verification

### Next Steps:
- Proceed with Step 2: Three.js integration
- Ensure Three.js library loads correctly
- Set up basic 3D scene
