## Definitive Tech Stack

### 1. Front-End: **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- **Purpose**: Forms the backbone of your game’s structure, styling, and logic.
- **Why It Fits**:
  - **Simplicity**: These are the core web technologies—no frameworks or build tools required. You can write everything in plain code, making it easy to start and maintain.
  - **Robustness**: Universally supported across desktop and mobile browsers, with extensive documentation and community resources.
  - **Alignment**: Perfect for a static website hosted on GitHub Pages, handling your UI (main menu, HUD) and game logic locally.

### 2. Game Library: **Three.js**
- **Purpose**: Powers the 3D graphics and physics for your zero-gravity arena and spaceship movement.
- **Why It Fits**:
  - **Simplicity**: Integrates seamlessly with JavaScript and HTML5 canvas, requiring minimal setup for 3D rendering and full 3D movement.
  - **Robustness**: A lightweight yet powerful library, widely used for browser-based 3D games, ensuring smooth performance for your minimalistic visuals (spaceships, starry background, safe zone).
  - **Alignment**: Handles your third-person camera, collision detection (bouncing ships), and glowing boundary effects efficiently.

### 3. Deployment: **GitHub Pages**
- **Purpose**: Hosts your game as a static website, accessible globally.
- **Why It Fits**:
  - **Simplicity**: Free and easy to use—just push your HTML, CSS, JS, and assets to a GitHub repository, and it’s live. No server management needed.
  - **Robustness**: Reliable uptime and fast loading via GitHub’s CDN, supporting your performance goals on desktop and mobile browsers.
  - **Alignment**: Meets your goal of a static, browser-based game that works out of the box with minimal setup.

### 4. Audio (Optional): **Howler.js**
- **Purpose**: Adds sound effects and music for immersion (e.g., thrust “whoosh,” collision “clank,” ambient track).
- **Why It Fits**:
  - **Simplicity**: A lightweight library that integrates easily with JavaScript and Three.js, requiring minimal code to trigger sounds on events.
  - **Robustness**: Optimized for web games, ensuring audio playback doesn’t impact performance.
  - **Alignment**: Supports your optional audio goals while keeping the stack lean and client-side.

## How It Comes Together
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: Build the main menu, HUD (score, timer, boost cooldown), and game loop.
- **Three.js**: Render the 3D arena (safe zone, spaceships, starry background), implement physics (thrust, collisions), and control the camera.
- **GitHub Pages**: Host the single-page app, making it instantly playable.
- **Howler.js (Optional)**: Add sound effects and music triggered by game events (e.g., thrusting, elimination).
