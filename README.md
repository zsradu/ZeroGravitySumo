# **Zero-Gravity Sumo Game**

*Zero-Gravity Sumo* is a fast-paced, single-player game set in a zero-gravity space arena. The player controls a spaceship, aiming to push AI-controlled bots out of a central "safe" zone while avoiding elimination themselves. The game offers full 3D movement, a third-person camera, and a dynamic environment where bots can join or leave at any time, even mid-round. Itâ€™s designed to be simple, engaging, and replayable, with minimalistic 3D visuals and intuitive controls, simulating a multiplayer feel through bot interactions.
